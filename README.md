## Current activities

### HPC specialist at University of Lausanne

From February 2020, I've joined the Scientific Computing and Research Support Unit of the University of Lausanne.

I provide researchers of the University with the following support:
* parallel computing (CPU and GPU): OpenMP, MPI, Cuda
* scientific programming: Python, C++, Julia, R
* code optimization
* courses: Linux, parallel computing with Python and Julia, Python/R/Singularity on the clusters

I'm also in charge of some DevOps tasks dedicated to our research infrastructures like:
* automated provisioning of the virtual infratructure
* automated provisioning of HPC resources: scheduler accounts and storage systems

## Past activities

### DevOps team leader at Quarkslab

From 2016 to 2020, I've been working at Quarkslab, a high-end cyber-security company based in Paris.

I was in charge of:
* Automated deployment and scalability of the products
* System hardening
* Continuous integration
* Infrastructure

### Research engineer at Inria

From 2008 to 2016, I've been working as a research engineer in computer science at Inria (Saclay and Nancy research centers).

My interests were:
* Distributed systems
* High performance computing
* Software defined networks
* Parallel computing
* Cloud and Grid infrastructures

Some projects I worked on:
* Distributed systems emulator (see the Distem project)
* Cluster deployment (see the Kadeploy3 project)
* Bringing the SOFA framework for advanced medical simulation to the operating room (see the SOFA-OR project)

Community tasks
* Operational lead of the national Continuous Integration service
* Tutor for some young software engineers
* Spread best practices for software development

### Ph.D. thesis

* Title: Middleware for the efficient and reliable execution of distributed applications in dynamic and very large scale grids
* Advisor: Christine Morin
* Summary:
    The emergence of the grid computing allows the scientific community to consider the access to an unequaled computing power. However, some characteristics of a grid like the large scale, the dynamic behavior of the resources that compose the grid and their heterogeneity make its use very complex. This thesis study the design of system services for the execution of distributed applications in large scale grids. Thanks to a fully distributed and a generic approach, our system can harness the resources of any grid model, even those composed of dynamic and heterogeneous resources. In order to simplify the use of a grid, we suggest to provide users with a single system image that allows to hide the distribution of the resources. We also suggest services designed to execute a wide range of distributed applications in an efficient and reliable way.

### Master thesis

* Title: Quality of service in active networks
* Advisors: Hervé Guyennet, Éric Garcia, David Fuin
* Summary:
    The aim was to implement quality of service mechanisms in active networks. In this purpose, we have presented the concepts of quality of service and active networks, then we have drawn up an overview of existing works. Next, we have proposed an original mechanism of quality of service in active networks based on streams classification and scheduling. We have implemented this in ANTS and Tamanoir active nodes. Finally, we have realised experimentations in order to validate and to test the efficacity of our implementations.
